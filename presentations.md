## The Assertion-Evidence Model of Slide Design
* Mostly used to effectively present results

#### Clearly assert the slide's main idea in a complete sentence. 
* Reason: human understands concepts in the unit of a sentence. A subject and a verb are both neccessary
* appears at the top of the slide
* contains one distinct point
* flows logically from previous slide

#### Reinforce the argument with visual evidence
* diagrams/charts/images
* functional â€“ not decorative/distracting-visuals 
* minimize distractions, focus on contents

#### Simplify slide design
* only include essential information on the slide, verbally deliver the details
* eliminate non-data ink (e.g. bullet points, gridlines, etc)

#### Control focal points
* highlight important points with read/bold/circle 
* use annotations as call-outs

#### Other checks
* left-align
* two-line max
* at least 30pt font

#### Use it for describing methods
* one sentence as the method overview

## What Should be Included in the Introduction?
* Significance  (meta why)
* Status Quo (already known)
* Identify a gap (call to arms)
* Fill a gap (distinguisher, contribution)
